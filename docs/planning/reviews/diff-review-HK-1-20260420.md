## Staged files

- `REVIEW.md`

## Notes

Staging-only chore; baseline gates verified by orchestrator (tsc 0, lint 0, test 8/8, e2e-scenarios ALL PASS). Per-commit gates will re-run via hook.

Enables: landing a REVIEW.md artifact at repo root capturing the HK review session output for subsequent traceability.
